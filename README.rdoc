== CourseSniper

CourseSniper is a rails app that polls the my.illinois.edu course directory for open spots in a class that the user specifies. When courseSniper finds that there is a spot open, it automatically registers you for that class and sends you a notification via email.

== ToDo

1. Set up polling
2. Mechanize auto-register
3. make user/password app arguments instead of hard-code
4. Set up notifs
